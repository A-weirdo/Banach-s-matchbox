# Banach-s-matchbox



History : Banach's match problem is a classic problem in probability attributed to Stefan Banach. Feller says that the problem was inspired by a humorous reference to Banach's smoking habit in a speech honoring him by Hugo Steinhaus, but that it was not Banach who set the problem or provided an answer.

Q:
Suppose a mathematician carries two matchboxes at all times: one in his left pocket and one in his right. Each time he needs a match, he is equally likely to take it from either pocket.
Suppose he puts his hand in his pocket and picks up the last match of one of the boxes. If it is assumed that each of the matchboxes originally contained N matches, what is the probability that there are exactly k matches in the other box ?


if you want the mathematical proof you can check proof folder to see it.

and I simulated for N equals  20 , 40 , 60
